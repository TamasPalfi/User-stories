<center><h3><b>Non-Functional Requirement</b></h3></center>

### FrontEnd 
***React.js***   
- React is very a simple and lightweight library that only deals with the view layer. It is not a beast like other MV* frameworks such as Angular or Ember. Since, one team is going to take care of the frontend, it's good for them to only focus on view layer. 

- React provides a component based structure. As a result:
    - your app has consistent look and feel.
    - code re-use makes it easier to maintain and grow your codebase.
    - it is easier to develop your app.

- Updating DOM is usually the bottleneck when it comes to the web performance. React efficiently compares the previous and current states of the virtual DOM and calculates the best way (minimum amount of updates needed) to apply these changes. This is the main reason behind Reactâ€™s high performance.


### Backend 
***Node.js***

- Very fast. 
- Node.js uses V8 engines by Google. 
- With inbuilt NPM, developers can refresh, share or reuse code with ease. 
- Node.js increases productivity. 
- Event driven/single-threaded. 
- Library for everything. 
- A simple NPM install command does nearly everything. 

### Credit Card Software 
***Stripe.js*** 
- Transparent pricing. 
- Simple integration with node.js.

### Automated Email 
***Sendgrid***

- Deliverability. 
- Avoids emails going to spam folder/rejection by mail server.  
- Throughput. 
- Handles large volumes. 
- Analytics and Transparency 
- Tracks email performance, read, etc. 
- Verifies whether email has reached destination. 
- OptOuts 
- Ability to prevent mailing to certain addresses in a separate layer, rather than relying on applications. 
- Simple integration with node.js. 

### Database 
***PostgreSQL***

- Data model. 
- Is not just relational but object-relational. Advantageous over other open source SQL databases such as MySQL, MariaDB and Firebird. 
- Data types and structures. 
- Extensive list of data types that PostgreSQL supports. 
- Network addresses. 
- PostgreSQL allows storing different network address types. 
- Multi-dimensional arrays. 
- PostgreSQL is an object-relational database, so arrays of values can be stored for most existing data types. 
- JSON support. 
- Allows you to go schema-less in an SQL database. 
- Create new types. 
- Use CREATE TYPE command to create new data types as composite, enumerated, range and base.
