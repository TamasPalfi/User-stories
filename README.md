<summary>Admin</summary>

### 26. Administrator Removes Member's Access to Member's Only
Administrator Ava is working through checking the flagged content on the Member’s Only site, and she encounters the profile of Jonas (a member) who was flagged for posting inappropriate content.  Ava directs herself to view Jonas’s profile via frontend interactions.  From there, she must review all the flagged content on his profile and come to a decision on whether Jonas should be removed or not from Member’s Only.  Ava concludes that Jonas must be removed for violating the site’s posting policy.  She selects the “Remove Member” button via the webpage which should then cause a confirmation pop-up to occur.  Ava selects the “Yes” option which causes the web server to receive that request and send the needed backend services to comply with that order.  The backend removes Jonas as a member by effectively deleting the profile page and all associated comments with the profile, but the personal data is retained.  

### 27. Administrator Removes Content Flagged as Inappropriate/Illegal
Administrator Ava is working through checking the flagged content on the Member’s Only site when she receives a report of inappropriate content in the form of a flagged photo.  Ava directs herself to review the flagged photo via frontend interactions, and she must come to a decision on whether the photo should be removed or not.  After noticing that the photo does indeed contain child pornography images on it, Ava proceeds with removing the photo.  She selects the “Remove Post/Photo” button on the web page which would cause a confirmation pop-up to occur.  After selecting the “Yes” button, the web server receives that request to remove post and directs it to the backend.  The backend then removes the flagged photo from the page AND the database (no need to keep flagged data).  

### 28. Administrator Edits Member's Photo
Administrator Andrew wants to make Member’s Only the best visually pleasing web-page out there.  Thus, he decides he wants to edit a member’s photo to add a filter in the hopes that it would increase web traffic to the site.  First, Andrew directs the web page via frontend interactions to the photo on Curtis’s (a member) profile that he would like to edit. Andrew selects the “Edit” button next to the photo, and he uses the photo editing software to apply a color filter.  After making the necessary revisions, he selects the “Save” button which would cause a confirmation pop-up to occur.  Andrew confirms he’s satisfied with the changes by selecting the “Yes” button.  The web server gets this request to save and sends it to the backend.  The backend then saves this new photo to the database as well without removing the original photo.  However, the filter has been added and the photo is updated correctly.  Adding filters is not the only thing that Andrew can do to Curtis’s photo. He could also choose to add sponsored content which he would do to also increase web traffic and revenue in terms of partnerships.  The process Andrew take to do that is nearly identical to the filtering case except Andrew uses the photo editing software to input another image (the sponsored content) onto the photo rather than apply a filter.  It’s also important to note that these two interactions described above could very well occur as or in a comment instead of a post.  This is as simple as just a different location where Andrew is working to change content from.  A final comment is that visibility does have an effect here, as Curtis would not see the changed content on his own profile but rather what he originally posted.

<summary>Idol</summary>

### 29. Idol Has All Privleges of a Member
Tony loves using Member’s Only, and as a popular social figure he has the designation from the Member’s Only site as an idol.  That basically grants him additional capabilities on the site outside of what a normal member can do such as unlimited invitations and ability to post sponsored content.  However, it is important to remember the fact that Tony still is essentially a member.  Thus, as such, he can do all the basic functionally that a member does such as posting a status update, commenting, posting a photo, and applying filters to photos.

### 30. Idol Invites a New Member
Tony, an idol, wants to contribute to the web site’s overall member base count by inviting new members to the site.  He does this to increase the web traffic to Member’s Only and increase his own revenue.  There are two ways an idol can send invitations; the normal way for most members which is through an email invitation or via code referral.  To send via email invitation link, Tony selects the “Send Invitation Link” button on the web page.  He enters the email address of his friend Bruce which is bruce4321@gmail.com, and the system confirms that it is a valid email address. It is in fact a valid email address, so Tony selects the “Confirm” button to send the invitation link.  It’s important to note here that as an idol, Tony has unlimited number of invitations, so he doesn’t get docked any points upon inviting his friend.  The next way of inviting is through the code system.  Tony will generate a random, new invitation code which will be suitable for one invitation only.  Tony can then give this code out through a variety of means either through person, message, Facebook, or any other communication means.  Whoever receives this code from Tony, then must use it when signing up for Member’s Only.

### 31. Idol's Visibility
Since idols are the “Popular” faces of Member’ Only, we want it to be the case that all members should be allowed to see their profiles. Thus, idols don’t have the visibility toggle option as a part of their profile allowing all members to be able to follow their profile.  This differs from regular members in which they can toggle their visibility of their profile from specific members.

<summary>System</summary>

### System Deducts Points From Member  
The backend receives a request from the frontend. The backend sent a request to the credit card company using a credit card software.
If the credit card is denied, the system freezes the member’s account and changes the permission of the member in a database. 
If the request is successful, the database finds the matched member and takes a point off. Then the system sends updated point information to the frontend. The frontend updates the point information in a local storage and Alex will recoginize the changes.

### System Awards Points to Member

### System Receives Registration Request From Frontend 
A potential New Member, Bob, fills out a registration form and selects the "Register" button. Backend receives a request containing a potential New Member's information. If the credit card information currently exists with database, backend sends error to frontend and Bob receives error message. If the credit card information does not exist within database, System checks that given credit information is valid using credit card software. If data is valid, System stores New Member information in database. Frontend will redirect Bob to *Members Only* login page. If the data is **not** valid, backend sends error to frontend and Bob must enter valid credit card details.

### System Collects/Stores Member's Information
Alex performs specific expected actions. The frontend detects an item being clicked when a member clicks a specific post or recognizes an item(content) on the current screen (if a member stays longer than a particular second at the same page without scrolling down or going out to other pages). The frontend sends the item(content) information to the backend. The backend receives the data and stores them in the database.

### System Converts URL to Shortened URL 
The frontend sends the request to a backend. Then the frontend sends a request to the backend with original URL information. The backend gets the request and uses a hash function to generate a shortened URL. The system saves the shortened URL into the database. The system sends the shortened URL to the frontend. In the case of the system can't perform shortening, it will use the original URL.
