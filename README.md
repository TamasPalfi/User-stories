# What is Members Only?

Members Only is a social media site where users, known as Members, can post statuses, photos, links, and everything else that one may post on another social media outlet. So what makes us different you may ask? Exclusivity. Not just anyone can join Members Only. You have to receive an invitation from another Member or be lucky enough to get an entrance code from one of our Idols. This makes Members Only a gated community, where we can house exactly the people that we want to be on the site. This is formulated and handpicked data, which can, and will, be used for a multitude of purposes. 

# The Pillars of Members Only

## Members

Members are our users. They are the the traffick, the data, and most importantly; the revenue. Members are able to access the site via a login page that brings them to their feed, where by default they are connected with every other Member on the site. This allows them to see the statuses, photos, and anything other form of output from every other Member on the site. Otherwise, Members have the option to privatize their profile so that they can only be seen by their followers (other Members who either invited this Member or were invited by this Member). But the most important question is, what do Members bring? The answer is: data. And heaps of it. We plan to store all of Members posts, comments, photos, filtered photos, the time they spend on certain areas of the site, what statuses and links draw their attention, and anything else imaginable. All of this knowledge will allow us to carefully curate advertisements for each individual user as to draw the most potential revenue to the site. And for all their actions on the site, we reward Members with points. A simple mechanism that will keep Members wanting to keep coming back to the site. They post a photo and filter it? Have some points. They post a status that receives a lot of comments? Have some points. A Member successfully gets a new Member to join the site? Have some points. And with these points, Members can choose to use them to invite new Members to the site, expanding their circle of friends within the gated community. This allows Members to create subcommunities within the overarching Members Only site, which will keep Members entranced with the website. Without Members, Members Only doesn't exist. 

## Idols

Idols are our bedrock from which we build the site. We will pay Idols to be some of the first enhanced Members on the site. Enhanced meaning that they have all the functionality of a normal Member, but they also have unlimited points and invitation codes which they can use to send invitations to Members Only to all of their fans. In this sense, Idols are the first step in attracting large waves of Members to join the site and get it off the ground. Once on the site, Members can see all of their idols updates, effectively joining the community of the Idols. 

## Administrators

Administrators are our next enhanced Member. First and foremost, we have admins to keep the peace. Admins will manually review any flagged content to make sure that no illicit material makes it on to Members Only. Although Members Only is a gated community, we do not want to establish a reputation for allowing unlawful material on our site. Furthermore, admins will solve disputes between Members, effectively making sure that our Members are happy on the site. Finally, admins will be able to insert sponsored content and different filters into other Members photos as to please advertisers of the site. Additionally, administrators will be able to add links, comments, and other materials into Members posts for advertising and any other purposes of the site. And of course, the original poster will not be able to see the changes that were made to their posts, but everyone else on the site will be able to.
